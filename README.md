# Marcio-Camassa-Responsive-CV

Hello Future Employer! 
 I'm certain that nowadays is a bit hard to trust in a CV,
 as we all know experiences can be exagerated, or even completely made up.
 That's why I had the Idea of a verification process inside the cv, With QR codes in case it is printed, 
 and with a verification button if you see it on your laptop. 
 
 The verification consists in links to various proofs of employement, like Contracts, Start dates, Salaries, and more
 I hope I hear from you soon. Thank's!
